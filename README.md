# E-ARCP
The “Exact Solution Approach to the Collaborative Multi-vehicle Arc Routing for Connectivity Problem” (E-ARCP) is a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MIP) model designed to solve the Collaborative Multi-vehicle Prize Collecting Arc Routing for Connectivity Problem (MPC-ARCP). The MPC-ARCP is introduced in Souza Almeida et al. (2023), where a full description of the MIP model can be found.
